Real Estate Price Prediction Website Project

This data science project series walks through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. The second step would be to write a Python Flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The third component is the website built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows the user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms, etc., and it will call the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building, we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, etc.

Technologies and Tools Used:

1. Python
2. NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Scikit-learn for model building
5. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
6. Python Flask for HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI
